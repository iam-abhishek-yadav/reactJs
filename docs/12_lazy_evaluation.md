In React, using JSX (`<Component />`) instead of invoking components directly (`Component()`) offers several advantages related to lazy evaluation and performance optimization:

### Lazy Evaluation in JSX:

1. **Deferred Execution**:
   - When you use JSX to pass a component as an element (`<Component />`), React doesn't immediately invoke the component function. Instead, it creates a React element object that represents the component.
   - For example, in `<Page><Comments /></Page>`, React creates an element that specifies `Comments` as a child of `Page`, but `Comments` itself isn't executed until React decides to render it.

2. **Conditional Rendering**:
   - Components like `<Page>` can conditionally render their children based on props or state, as shown in the example where `<Page>` checks if the user is logged in before rendering `<Comments>`.
   - If `<Page>` decides not to render `<Comments>` (e.g., if the user isn't logged in), React never calls the `Comments` function. This avoids unnecessary computation and potential side effects.

3. **Avoiding Fragile Code**:
   - Using JSX allows components to declare their intended structure without immediately executing functions. This makes the code less prone to unexpected behavior or errors, such as executing functions that should only run under certain conditions.

### Example Comparison:

#### Direct Function Invocation:
```jsx
<Page>
  {Comments()} {/* Always executes Comments() */}
</Page>
```
In this case, `Comments()` would execute regardless of whether `Page` decides to render it or not, leading to unnecessary computations and potential issues if `Comments` has side effects.

#### JSX Element:
```jsx
<Page>
  <Comments /> {/* React decides when to execute Comments */}
</Page>
```
Here, `Comments` is passed as a JSX element. React manages when to invoke `Comments`, ensuring it's only executed if `Page` decides to render it based on its logic (like checking `user.isLoggedIn`).
