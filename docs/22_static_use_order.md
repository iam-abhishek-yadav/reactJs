In React, Hooks such as `useState` are designed to be used at the top level of functional components and unconditionally. This design ensures predictable behavior and facilitates how React manages component state and updates.

### Why Use Hooks at the Top Level?

1. **Predictability**: React expects Hooks to be called in the same order every time a component renders. This ensures that React can properly track and update state between renders.

2. **Internal Implementation**: Hooks are internally managed as linked lists, where each call to a Hook moves to the next item in the list. This sequential ordering ensures that React correctly associates state updates with the component and manages them efficiently.

3. **Consistency**: Placing Hooks at the top level ensures that their associated state and effects are correctly initialized and managed across renders. This avoids unexpected behavior that could occur if Hooks were conditionally called or nested deeper within components.

### Example of Correct Usage

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example:
- `useState` is called at the top level of the `Example` component.
- `count` and `setCount` are used directly within the component's JSX, ensuring they are always associated with the same piece of state.

### Issues with Conditional or Nested Usage

Attempting to use Hooks conditionally or within nested scopes can lead to issues:
- **State Isolation**: Each call to a Hook should have its own state. Placing Hooks within conditional blocks or functions can lead to unintended state initialization or cleanup behavior.
- **Debugging Complexity**: Conditional Hook calls can make it harder to reason about the component's state and effects, especially when debugging or optimizing performance.
